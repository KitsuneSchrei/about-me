I am a graduate of Office Administration: General, Executive, and Medical. I hope to one day run my own website and create a magazine. Regarding HTML I have a bit of experience through writing stories and editing code on websites when I was younger. Through websites like quizilla and gaiaonline the use of HTML allowed for change such as colour, bold, paragraph breaks, paragraphs, and italicizing. Currently, I am working on a personal project involving getting people together through their "fandoms", or personal things they enjoy doing such as reading comics, watching T.V. shows, dressing up as popular (or unpopular) characters, etc. I think I will enjoy this class and thank you for the opportunity.
